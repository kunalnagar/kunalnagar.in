👋 Hi. I'm Kunal.

👨‍💻 I work as a Frontend Developer at [HomeX][homex] in their Toronto office where we allow users to seamlessly schedule home service appointments.

⏱ Most recently, I worked at [ScaleGrid][scalegrid], enabling users to manage their database clusters by creating dashboards and monitoring solutions.

⏱ Before that, I was at [Viraltag][viraltag], a social media scheduling tool where I built their scheduler, chrome extension and iOS application from scratch.

✅ My primary job is to use JavaScript responsibly.
