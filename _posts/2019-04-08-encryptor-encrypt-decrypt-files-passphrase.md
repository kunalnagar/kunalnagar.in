Sometimes you just need a quick way to encrypt files securely using a passphrase. Not all operating systems have this functionality, especially Windows.

encrypt0r provides a simple drag and drop interface to encrypt/decrypt your files using a password.

## Technologies

encrypt0r is built on the latest technologies and available for all operating systems:

- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)
- [Open Source](https://github.com/kunalnagar/encrypt0r)

## Signing

If you download the app on Mac/Windows, you will get an untrusted developer warning. This is because the app is not signed by the developer (aka me). Signing an app requires a Signing Certificate that costs hundreds of dollars per year.

**Note:** It is absolutely safe to run the app on Mac/Windows.
