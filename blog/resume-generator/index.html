<p>My website is geared towards recruiters and folks to get to know me professionally. One of the things everyone looks at is the Resume. I offer my Resume as a PDF or a Text file as downloads on this site. When a recruiter reaches out, I just redirect them to my website and they can choose the format that works for them.</p>

<h2 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h2>

<p>Over the years, I’ve found myself updating my Resume and tweaking it’s format. The issue is that I have to do it twice - one for the PDF and another for the text. I’m a lazy developer and thought to myself - let’s automate this such that if there’s an update, I can only update it once and the PDF/text versions would be generated automatically. Another advantage with this approach is the ability to write a generator for a new format - like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.docx</code> that I plan on doing soon.</p>

<h2 id="json---single-source-of-truth">JSON - single source of truth</h2>

<p>Here’s why I decided to use JSON to store the data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to read and understand</li>
  <li>Self-describing syntax. By looking at the structure of a JSON document, it is possible to interpret the context</li>
  <li>Stored as simple text and can be easily parsed in multiple environments</li>
</ul>

<p>The source file can be found <a href="https://github.com/kunalnagar/kunalnagar.in/tree/master/scripts/resume">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-pdf">Creating a PDF</h3>

<p>After looking at the libraries available in the ecosystem, I decided to go with <a href="https://pdfkit.org/">pdfkit</a> as it was the easiest to get started and offered a simple enough syntax.</p>

<p>The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/kunalnagar/kunalnagar.in/blob/master/scripts/resume/create_pdf_file.js">here</a></p>

<p>Essentially, here’s what is happening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get resume data as a JSON object</li>
  <li>Create an empty PDF document with margins</li>
  <li>Set the output path</li>
  <li>Render the different sections of the Resume</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="creating-a-text-file">Creating a text file</h3>

<p>Writing this generator was a breeze as there is no third-party library required. All you need is to generate a template string and output it to a file using the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fswritefilesyncfile-data-options">fs</a> module.</p>

<h3 id="auto-generation-during-deployment">Auto-generation during deployment</h3>

<p>Now that we have our node scripts that generate PDF and text versions of our resume, it’s time to write a command to do so dynamically in the CI environment when this website gets generated.</p>

<p>We could also check-in these files into the git repo by manual generation. However, this is a problem for me as I tend to forget things unless enforced by a rule. When merging a PR, it is possible that I forget to run the node scripts locally. Hence, I decided to do this part in CI.</p>

<p>I created a dedicated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">package.json</code> <a href="https://github.com/kunalnagar/kunalnagar.in/blob/master/package.json#L14">script</a> to generate these files, but integrated it in the same <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">build</code> command that generates the website. This way, I didn’t have to change any of my CI/CD scripts.</p>

<h3 id="can-i-use-this-to-generate-my-own-resume">Can I use this to generate my own Resume?</h3>

<p>Absolutely! As long as you are using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>, you should be able to copy the source JSON format, tweak it to add your own data/work experience and run the respective generator to generate the file.</p>

<hr />

<p>And that’s it! Any time I make a change to the source JSON data, all formats are regenerated and deployed automatically.</p>
